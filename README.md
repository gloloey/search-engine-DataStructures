# search-engine-DataStructures
Search engine written for Data Structures class at Yeshiva University for the Spring 2024 semester. Implemented:
- HashMap
- Heap
- Stack
- Trie
- B-Tree
  
Used the above data structures to build a search engine that works with the file system & manages internal memory usage. Tested each part with JUnit.
